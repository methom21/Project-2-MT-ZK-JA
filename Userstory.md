                                                                                     DESCRIPTION
We are creating an application that when the user is on the website they will be able to pick a deck of superhereos and villains from the DC and Marvel universes. The user will make an account and it will save their deck and their login info. They will be able to look up superheroes and villains and see a pictue of the character along with statistics. 



                                                                                  FUTURE DEVELOPEMENT
for the future we would like to develope it into a real game where a user would be able to battle other people and their decks. there will be a maximum power number that the user cant pass so the power statistic of their characters will be added up and if it passes the max number you wont be able to use them and will have to pick a character with lower powere to meet the criteria.
